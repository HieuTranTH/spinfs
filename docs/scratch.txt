time duration of erase operation:


dumping the whole flash always have bit-flip errors until 0x001000 (first 4096 bytes)

can only read maximum 4092 bytes at once (+4 bytes for command and address = 4096 bytes in total), before return all 0. This is because the default maximum SPI transfer is 4096 bytes with the standard Linux driver.

cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz = 4096
