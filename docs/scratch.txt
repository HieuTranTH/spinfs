time duration of erase operation:


dumping the whole flash always have bit-flip errors until 0x001000 (first 4096 bytes)

can only read maximum 4092 bytes at once (+4 bytes for command and address = 4096 bytes in total), before return all 0. This is because the default maximum SPI transfer is 4096 bytes with the standard Linux driver.

cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz = 4096

each read BUSY bit function took 0.000021 seconds of CPU time
programming a page of 256 bytes took 20 polling count to read BUSY bit (0.00042 s)
erase a sector of 4096 bytes took 2503 polling count to read BUSY bit (0.052563 s)
erase a block of 65536 bytes took 40881 polling count to read BUSY bit (0.858501 s)
erase chip of 8388608 bytes took 4754661 polling count to read BUSY bit (99.847881 s)

Reading the erased region right after being erased might give garbage data (give it at least couple seconds to stabilize)
